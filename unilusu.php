		  <h1>About Adamson University</h1>
		  <p>Adamson University has endured the tests of history, first as a Greek-run school and then as a Catholic and Vincentian institution. </p>
			<p>It has emerged academically richer and stronger, accumulating layers of knowledge and experience that sustain its mission to provide </p>
<p>education—the kind that meets stringent standards of quality yet affordable to those who have less. Now beyond its Diamond Jubilee, </p>
<p>it confidently and ably plays its role as an agent of personal as well as social transformation.</p>
